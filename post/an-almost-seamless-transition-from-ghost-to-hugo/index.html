Ghost has been sitting on an older version for a long time, my certs were expiring, and I did something about it.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;</h2>
<p>My blog engine and hosting were deteriorating fast, so I moved to GitHub Pages, Hugo, and Static Site Generation, (mostly) without losing or breaking anything.</p>
<h2 id="synopsys">Synopsys</h2>
<p>Years ago I moved from WordPress to Ghost. This let me get on with writing and not worrying about the hosting. I moved it to Azure and even added a dynamic SSL certificate rotator using Lets Encrypt.</p>
<p>Eventually, the cert rotator broke, and the blog engine got enough major versions behind to make the upgrade path non-trivial to fix. Not to mention Google Ads decided my site wasn&rsquo;t good enough for them and so disabled any ads that could have shown up. Hosting costs on Azure, while small, were a factor to think about too.</p>
<p>Around the time I decided to do something about it, I also started paying attention to other people using static site generation to host their blogs. It didn&rsquo;t take long to find a few really great articles that showed how simple this was going to be. The simplest of which seemed to be <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. So that is the path I went down.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well</h2>
<p>My initial research was well-founded, and I very easily found the tool <a href="https://github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo">jbarone/ghostToHugo</a> designed for the job.</p>
<p>Initially, everything was super simple, and I had my content in Hugo in under an hour. Mainly I was following youngkin&rsquo;s article: <a href="https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/">Create a Free Blog Site Using GitHub Pages and Hugo</a>, and then using ghostToHugo for my content.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Install Hugo CLI locally</a></li>
<li>create basis repository setup with the suggested theme <a href="https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/">youngkin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ghost.org/help/the-importer/">export my Ghost backup</a></li>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo">ghostToHugo</a> tool</li>
<li>run ghostToHugo to migrate posts into the site</li>
<li>run locally to test</li>
</ul>
<p>(I&rsquo;m not repeating details here, because <a href="https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/">youngkin</a> has it nailed.)</p>
<p>Getting this running on GitHub Pages was easy following that article too. Even setting a CNAME and DNS (a temporary subdomain while testing of course) was nice and easy to get working. (I use <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a>.) Job done. Right?</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h2>
<p><strong>RSS.</strong> My RSS feed has been a bit of an issue really. I knew it would probably break, and it wasn&rsquo;t even available out of the box on Hugo either. So I fevered away adding RSS generation to the site generation and getting a fair approximation of my old feed. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be perfect, but I learned a bit about how the templating engine worked along the way. And when that hot cutover day came, it certainly failed. I had a few bugs to fix and all 50 people who have added this blog to their feed probably got a bit of a noisy mess. But hopefully, as they now read this article they now understand why. Also, there are now sub-categories with sub-category RSS feed URLs linked to from the right-hand sidebar now.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Theming.</strong> I built my custom theme way back when I moved to Ghost. And I didn&rsquo;t really feel like losing it. So I painstakingly mapped it from the Ghost templating engine to the one Hugo uses. This sucked. and it took ages (weeks) to get it right. Along the way, I probably did make some improvements that will be valuable later, like fixing the sidebar and better image handling possibilities. But this was probably the most time-consuming part of the whole process. In the end, retrologs&rsquo; <a href="https://retrolog.io/blog/creating-a-hugo-theme-from-scratch/">Creating a Hugo Theme From Scratch</a> was super useful at figuring out what went where, but I don&rsquo;t actually understand some parts of the collection lookup code I wrote in some places yet. But it worked. At the very least, my CSS appears to have held the test of time (surprisingly!).</p>
<p><strong>Permalinks.</strong> Turns out Ghost had a few permalink redirect capabilities. And also the default URLs in Ghost were <code>/slug-for-page/</code> while Hugo is <code>/post/slug-for-page/</code>. Luckily the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases">Aliases feature in Hugo</a> allowed me to add both the draft/preview link (<code>/p/&lt;GUID&gt;/</code>) as well as the old URL so that hopefully, no one loses my content, and instead get bounced to the right place.</p>
<p><strong>Disqus.</strong> See the comments at the bottom? I&rsquo;ve been using Disqus to make them available. Turns out this was quite useful in moving to a static hosted solution. For the most part, this went well, because Disqus actually have a <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717068-migration-tools">migration tools feature</a> available to use to move the URL associated with a page. The what went wrong part was that I prepared all the pages that looked like the normal post URL (<code>/slug-for-page/</code>) before I cut over my DNS, but didn&rsquo;t map any of the preview URLs (<code>/p/&lt;GUID&gt;/</code>) across. I think what happened is that Ghost provided an id to Disqus as well as a URL, and it uses the first URL it sees as the identifying one. When I preview drafts, that preview URL is the one it saves. Since Hugo is just using the actual URL and not the id anymore, I lost my mapping over a few pages which I neglected to migrate. (My incorrect assumption was the draft ids didn&rsquo;t have comments 😢.) I was without comments on some pages while I remedied that across a couple of evenings. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad to put together a new CSV file for that though in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Google Ads.</strong> Turns out they are still not happy with my website (and neither am I to be fair) so there is a bit more work to get them reenabled. It barely makes dollars a month, to be honest, but with it not working it makes a lot less of course.</p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong> I spent far too much time looking at my content. While Ghost had tags, Hugo has both <a href="https://blog.csmac.nz/tags/">Tags</a> and <a href="https://blog.csmac.nz/categories/">Categories</a>. I went through every historic post (193 over 13 and a half years if you can believe it) and updated many tags (deleting a bunch, adding a few) and creating categories for my content. I could have spent days (and still might) tidying up some of the content that never had any attention since coming out of WordPress and getting auto-converted to markdown all those years ago. But I held back, since I wanted to actually get this process done and back to writing. There was a little bit of work migrating some of the image functionality over too, but for the most part that was fine, too.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Would I choose to do it again? Yes. I am certainly in a better place. So far, I think I&rsquo;ve backed the right horse in Hugo. The workflow seems about as good as it was before, and I am aware of a few tools such as <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/">CloudCannon</a> for better CMS management workflows if I desire. I might miss the Ghost app for drafts, but I mostly write on my desktop anyway. And since it is in GitHub, anything that can commit markdown to there is a way to draft.</p>
<p>Now that I have that done, the next step is likely to repeat the whole process with <code>csmac.nz</code> as well and fix its certs, ads, and content. (That last one has been bugging me since I moved to Ghost to be fair&hellip; <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>)</p>
