      <description>Good morning day 3. So much to absorb already from Day 1 and 2 but it isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet.
This morning&amp;rsquo;s Keynote &amp;ldquo;Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones&amp;rdquo; from Simon Wardley is a must see. This was a very educational look at the value of maps, and the importance of knowing the landscape, looking at Evolutionary Flow and not just Process Flow when looking at optimisations. I would recommend the talk from Susanne Kaiser &amp;ldquo;Preparing for a future Microservices journey&amp;rdquo; from the day before as a nice companion to this keynote talk, as she used &amp;ldquo;Wardley Maps&amp;rdquo; to specifically look at the evolution towards microservices.</description>

      <description>After a restful night at a London hotel (I learned my lesson from the last time I came in for a London conference) coffee and breakfast at the Business Design Centre in London, muCon 2019 kicks off. muCon (or µCon) is a Conference on Microservices, DDD &amp;amp; Software Architecture. From what I gather, this year for the first time it is an amalgamation of a DDD and Microservices conference into one.</description>

      <description>In my hand, I have a couple of train tickets. The reservations indicate that I left the house at 5 am Saturday morning to make the first train from Birmingham to Cambridge, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get home again until 9 pm. And that is exactly what I did.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been making more of an effort this year to attend conferences and community events. I had a blast at NDC Oslo 2018 (1,2) meeting some amazing people, off the back of that I heard about Birmingham Alt.</description>

      <description>Unlike some unfortunate people who found out on the day and missed out, I had the opportunity to attend the Alt.Net Unconference in Birmingham this Saturday.
Now I know some of you think Saturday Conferences are too far outside your work time. But hear me out on this first. This is a free event, which means no expensive expense approval. It included lunch so no personal cost apart from transport to get there.</description>

      <description>Day 2 Day 2 of NDC Oslo. A bit less productive than the first. I needed a longer lunch and missed a couple of slots, but made the most of talking to some of the speakers for a bit over the break. There is so much going on that it just felt necessary.
Never-the-less, I did still pack in a few good choices throughout the day.
Rise of the Tech Influencer First up was Michelle Sandford with her talk &amp;ldquo;Rise of the Tech Influencer - Small steps you can take to increase your reach&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>With 10 streams on, there has been a lot to choose from at NDC in Oslo. But as day one ends, I&amp;rsquo;ve now voted with my feet. And since I can&amp;rsquo;t be in two places at once (though the overflow does technically make this possible) these are the decisions I made, and a few takeaways from each.
Day 1 I was pretty much jumping from one session to the next today but had a little time to walk the stalls first.</description>

      <description>I recently attended the AWS Summit in London and thought I would give some notes on the event from my perspective.
As a developer working for a company that uses AWS, there was plenty to get out of an event such as this, and the free attendance makes a great business case to get the time to go.
I really enjoyed the schedule of talks that I attended, and the keynote was a good overview of the state of things as AWS, with some exciting insight into partners in Automotive, and Healthcare.</description>

      <description>I heard a great quote yesterday:
 You can&amp;rsquo;t out-exercise a bad diet
 And this is a great metaphor for technical debt.
We all agree that you need to pay down your tech debt in your software. And it&amp;rsquo;s great to commit to addressing a little technical debt during each sprint. The problem is that this is the exercise. And if you still have a bad diet of cutting corners and taking shortcuts, your stuck with an overweight system (a monolith, if you like).</description>

      <description>Well, mostly.
I hear the excuse a lot from developers, &amp;ldquo;Oh, because I am lazy&amp;rdquo;. This seems to be some sort of way of justifying the way we do some of our development, automation scripts, bash power-user commands like grep and awk, even writing a program to solve something we could do ourselves manually. Unfortunately, even copy+paste development. We don&amp;rsquo;t do ourselves any favours using the term lazy though, since not all words can have their meanings reversed, unlike literally.</description>

      <description>Ok, so I know I am in the minority as a Windows Phone user, but sometimes I just get frustrated and I wish Microsoft at least tried to achieve parity with their platforms, and not leave it to others who just won&amp;rsquo;t bother.
I have a really nice Acer Liquid Jade Primo Windows 10 mobile phone. Continuum, Hexa Core Processor, 3GB memory, nice 5.5&amp;quot; screen, great camera.
Yesterday I went shopping and saw the really nice Fossil Q watches.</description>

      <description>The nice thing about git is that branches are cheap and you can create many and varied branches for every little fix, format or feature. The annoying thing about GitHub is that every user creates many many many branches.
One of my pet peeves at the moment is a large number of branches on our upstream repository. That is, the shared common one we all fork from and Pull Request into.</description>

      <description>Some people have a natural gift to be able to learn. They can pick up any subject and by putting in hard work they can get good at it. Some people have a natural interest in a specific subject, and these people enjoy the process of learning and don’t find the work being put in as ‘hard’, but instead it is fun. They too will get good, or even great at this subject.</description>

      <description>Ok, so not that big a leap, it&amp;rsquo;s just me. Six months later me. Moved to the UK me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the plunge and moved away from Windy Wellington in little old New Zealand to a place in the UK called Milton Keynes. Famous for wide streets, round-a-bouts and concrete cows.
Why Milton Keynes? Because Xero has an office here of course! Aside from being cheaper to live here than in the middle of London, it&amp;rsquo;s also a bit quieter and a bit of a slower pace of life for a bit, with reasonable connections to anywhere but here.</description>

      <description>My Microsoft Band finally arrived yesterday morning, so obviously I put it straight on (after a charge of course). Here is a chronicle of first impressions.
Setup Out of the box, setup was really easy. Simply following the instructions on the band and the phone made it simple. I paired it with my Windows Phone (a Lumia 930) and as soon as the connection was made, the two devices started to chat to each other, downloading updates for the band using my phone&amp;rsquo;s internet connection.</description>

Yes, It&amp;rsquo;s the 2015 Global Day of Code Retreat on Saturday 14th November, and once again I have found myself involved. 4 years ago I attended my first GDCR in Wellington and it was great fun. Now, having stepped in to help facilitate last year, I have stepped up to Host it, with the help of a few of my colleagues as Xero.</description>

Luckily, the builder was an expert and explained to me what would have to be done.</description>

      <description>There is this concept that has been floating around for a while which says you should treat your servers as cattle, not pets. I came across another version of this analogy that I wanted to post, since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been recorded anywhere but has been mentioned in presentations. But before I get to that, let us look at what this phrase means, and where it came from.</description>

 Any problem can be solved by adding another layer of indirection. David Wheeler The follow up to this, of course, is to end it with the following:
 &amp;hellip;except for the problem of too many layers of indirection. Kevlin Henney I am here to provide a proof of sorts, that disproves the latter and re-enforces the former.</description>

      <description>It may not be simple, it may not be easy, but git is not scary. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git for less than a year now, professionally. I had dabbled in git personal projects for the year before that. My primary Source control had mostly been TFS (Team Foundation Server), and I had been exposed to subversion on a major project before too. Full disclosure, I&amp;rsquo;ve never used Visual SourceSafe. Just Sayin&#39;.</description>

      <description>It feels like everywhere I turn (in my circles anyway), people are talking about Ports and Adapters, and I thought I would jump on the bandwagon. You may have also heard this architecture called Onion Architecture, or Hexagonal Architecture. All of these are essentially the same idea, under a different name.
Brief History When we started solving our problems with a 3 tier architecture, we were trying to solve the problem of isolating our business logic from our persistence and from our presentation.</description>

      <description>The other day we were talking about problems we (as a room of developers) had been having with NuGet, inter-package dependencies, and were quick to relate them back to DLL Hell. But I had this slight epiphany from another comment, where it was observed that our X.Common package had &amp;lsquo;helper code&amp;rsquo; for database access, base class helpers, mathematical calculations, and domain logic common functions. Not to mention the dependencies it pulls in to allow some of this code to work (libraries, adapters, ORMs, frameworks etc).</description>

      <guid>https://csmacnzblog.github.io/post/semantics-vs-implementation-detail/</guid>
      <description>When we write out classes and variables, we are pretty good at naming them for what they represent. What I mean by this, is that when we declare a customer first name variable, we don&amp;rsquo;t call it firstNameString, or cfnString, and we have also lost the bad habit of firstNameStr or strFirstName. The implementation detail simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Semantically, it represents the customer&amp;rsquo;s first name, so we use customerFirstName. Or if we are clearly in the context of the customer we can simply use firstName or customer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through the regular evolution when it comes to writing tests. At first there was no time, didnt bother. This was mostly down to the fact I was building demo apps and samples that got less use than it took to build them, working with senior devs who had made their name making said apps.
The next stage is reluctant acceptance. The team I was put on wrote tests, so I guess I should too.</description>
