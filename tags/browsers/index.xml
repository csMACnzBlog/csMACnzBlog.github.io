      <description>It seems that Microsoft have already set their sites on the next generation web browser war, and this time they aim to win. It&amp;rsquo;s predecessor IE7 was released in late 2006, and was a sore dissapointment to some, but was also seen as a step in the right direction by others in the web development community. This all comes down to the battle of the standards, a war that has been going on since the start of the web years ago.</description>
