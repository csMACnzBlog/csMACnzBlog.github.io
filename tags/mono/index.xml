      <description>After much frustration, I now have monocovrunning on my Travis-CI build, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to share with you how I did it.
TL;DR The coverage results don&amp;rsquo;t seem accurate just yet, but jump to the end to see the full script to get it going on your build.
As I mentioned in a previous post, I am building a coveralls.iopublisher for .Net code coverage. This means (to me any way) that I need to support mono coverage as well.</description>
