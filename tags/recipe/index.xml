      <description>Yesterday at the supermarket, Mussels just happened to be on special, and after the last meal of Mussels I had cooked for me turned out so great, I thought I would give them a go. First things first, I had no recipe so performed some quick google magic and stubbled upon this great, simple recipe for Creamy Garlic &amp;amp; White Wine Mussels. Prep time: 20 minutes Cook time: 5 minutes Servings: 2 Ingredients: 1 dozen green lip mussels 6 cloves of garlic 1 1/2 cups of white wine (SauvignonBlanc worked well for me) 1 stalk of celery 1 small onion 1 tablespoon butter (but the more the better I found) 1/4 cup of cream (Maybe add a little more if you like a creamier broth, I&amp;rsquo;m keen to try coconut cream next time) **Directions:**Preparing mussels for cooking Scrub mussels well in sink with running cold water.</description>
