<p>Over the last week, Wellington has been taken over by shop front Mannequin displays. For those of you who missed it, it consisted of 10 different stories, 40 different mannequins, and a daily change of position to portray some interesting stories. Some even made it through the window to wander rooftop!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see every day, or even take photos like I would have wanted to, but I did find a collection in flicker for you all to enjoy, If your interested. It was a pretty cool concept and pulled off really well, with one exception.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s paper there is a nice article from an upset shop owner who wasn&rsquo;t happy when the mannequins put up a closing down sale sign in his show window, and they had to leave the shop. You can read more about that <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/entertainment/nz-international-arts-festival-2010/3448469/Dummies-evicted-over-shop-stunt" title="Dummies evicted over shop stunt ">here</a>.
