      <description>I originally set out to write about Polly. Then I started reading their documentation. I quickly realised that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write anything as detailed and accurate as they already had available.

What: We have retries over checking the queue (and other aws commands. We see many errors of WebException: The remote server returned an error: (504) Gateway Timeout happening quite a lot.</description>
