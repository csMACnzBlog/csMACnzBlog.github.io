      <title>Gulp vs .net</title>

      <description><p>I wanted to add continuous code coverage to my <a href="https://github.com/csmacnz/BCLExtensions">little extension library project</a>, and so realised i would need to run one of nCover, dotCover or openCover from the command line on my build server. This calls for a task based build automation library!</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m started to learn more about this nodejs thing as a .Net developer, I figured I should give one of the build automation projects from there a go, even though my project is a .Net library and I dont need node (even if it is a PCL).</p>
<h4 id="a-few-hurdles">A Few Hurdles</h4>
<p>So the first major problem is node itself. not a current dependancy from any of the project, so that needed to be installed. Not a big deal, i did have to hack around with powershell to set up node so that npm was recognised, but thats a once off per machine. Then I had to add a package.json file, that was that.</p>
<p>Next up was gulp, again, not too bad except that I did have issues getting gulp recognised as a command, but a few powershell restarts and some new PATH variables and that was fine too.</p>
<p>Now to get gulp to build and run my tests. Luckily there is a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-msbuild">gulp-msbuild</a> task that I could install, which works without much trouble. Unfortunately, there was no gulp-mstest. after much trial and error, I found and used the node package <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/mstest">mstest</a>, and jumped some extra hoops to do a manual gulp task for that. I notice that there is a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-mstest">grunt-mstest</a> available, and a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-nunit">gulp-nunit</a>, so not too big a deal for others that might be following a similar path.</p>
<p>I even managed to get a AssemblyInfo rewritter build step as well, which was a nice, but unnecessary bonus at this stage.</p>
<p>About now, after several hours mucking about, I realised that I had achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced an unnecessary dependancy on nodeJS</li>
<li>Added new node-module dependancies to the setup of my build tasks that need downloading</li>
<li>Require you to spin up an entire node environment, just to shell out to command line applications to build and test my .Net project.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even got to code coverage and already feel I&rsquo;m breaking ground, and will need to build my own node libraries for gulp to run my tests and code coverage.  At this point I also realise since ive been doing the whole thing in powershell, I should just install psake and be done with it.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a web application in .Net and you will need a pipeline for less/sass/typescript/coffeescript/javascript , gulp is a nice way to go, and can even do the build, run the test, package to a zip and/or deploy to your environments for you.  But if all you have is a .Net library with no web requirements whatsoever, I recommend psake, with a little chocolatey for environment dependancies thrown in.</p>
