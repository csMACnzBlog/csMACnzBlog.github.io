      <description>Good morning day 3. So much to absorb already from Day 1 and 2 but it isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet.
This morning&amp;rsquo;s Keynote &amp;ldquo;Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones&amp;rdquo; from Simon Wardley is a must see. This was a very educational look at the value of maps, and the importance of knowing the landscape, looking at Evolutionary Flow and not just Process Flow when looking at optimisations. I would recommend the talk from Susanne Kaiser &amp;ldquo;Preparing for a future Microservices journey&amp;rdquo; from the day before as a nice companion to this keynote talk, as she used &amp;ldquo;Wardley Maps&amp;rdquo; to specifically look at the evolution towards microservices.</description>

      <description>After a restful night at a London hotel (I learned my lesson from the last time I came in for a London conference) coffee and breakfast at the Business Design Centre in London, muCon 2019 kicks off. muCon (or µCon) is a Conference on Microservices, DDD &amp;amp; Software Architecture. From what I gather, this year for the first time it is an amalgamation of a DDD and Microservices conference into one.</description>
