      <description>When Windows 8 came out, I got really into the new shortcuts and found out some had been there for a while that I never knew about. Windows 10 is out now and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few more that have been around just as long that I never knew. Since there are a lot of shortcuts, I&amp;rsquo;ve split this into two parts.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded to windows 10 and are really enjoying it. But are you making the most of the visualisations it now provides you?
Since Aero came onto the scene in Vista, Windows has leveraged your graphics card to add heaps of whiz-bang effects to windows. Transparent windows, animating transitions and other such visual effects. With Windows 10 we have new ones, such as the multiple desktops transition, and the new interpretation of the task switcher labeled Task View.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Windows 10 Insider Previews on my Dell Latitude ST2E Tablet for a few months and It has been a bit hit and miss. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed the experience of previewing what&amp;rsquo;s coming, but it has been quite buggy up until the 10158/10159 builds leading up to the July 29th RTM. But there is one bug that has survived for me that, through wishful thinking I had expected to just go away after a while.</description>
