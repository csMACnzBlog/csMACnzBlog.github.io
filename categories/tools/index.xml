      <description>Christmas 2014. I was building out projects on GitHub in open source. The obsession with open source even went on to spawn a Series of Blog Posts.

      <description>This is part of a wireframing series
 Overview First Draft Balsamiq Blend with Sketchflow  This is a companion post to my talk at welliDotNet, Wellington&amp;rsquo;s .Net User Group on Wednesday 4th April 2012. The slides can be downloaded here.
I want to give you a brief introduction to creating designs and mockups for applications from a developers point-of-view, to enlighten other developers on the cool tools available and to inform designers that there are tools out there that can create great UX prototypes for clients, that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a developer to use.</description>
