      <description><p>It has been a pipe-dream of mine for a while to have my very own C# extensions library. Well now I do.  I&rsquo;ve been chipping away at a library on github for ages (my init commit was <strong>15 Sep 2012!</strong>) and it is finally a real thing! I&rsquo;ve got a V1.0.0, a Nuget package, and even 100% coverage. I even have the <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3770">coverity report</a> running, although it&rsquo;s taken so long that I don&rsquo;t have anything to worry about right now.  So far there are 24 Extensions available to use.</p>
<p>As a bonus, my library is a PCL using profile 328, which pretty much means it will work with any C# application you are writting.  I even have it building and running all my test on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/csMACnz/BCLExtensions">Travis-CI</a> (252 tests and counting).</p>
<p>Please feel free to grab the nuget at <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BCLExtensions">nuget.org/packages/BCLExtensions</a> and check the source as <a href="https://github.com/csMACnz/BCLExtensions">github.com/csMACnz/BCLExtensions</a>.</p>
<p>Next steps: keep knocking out the extensions from my wishlist, get resharper&rsquo;s inspectcode.exe command-line tool running, and tidy up all the documentation onto the wiki and maybe on of the docs services.</p>
<p>Have suggestions? Or are there extensions on my list that you want me to prioritise? Open an issue and let me know.</p>
