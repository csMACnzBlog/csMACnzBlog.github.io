      <description>I decided a while ago that the next language I would try to learn is Rust. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go too much into Rust other than to repeat its own summary:
 Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. &amp;ndash; https://www.rust-lang.org/
 But like all things, there are bits that need to be installed. I want to get started, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to muck around with installers.</description>
