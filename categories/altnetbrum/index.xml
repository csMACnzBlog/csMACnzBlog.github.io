      <description>Unlike some unfortunate people who found out on the day and missed out, I had the opportunity to attend the Alt.Net Unconference in Birmingham this Saturday.
Now I know some of you think Saturday Conferences are too far outside your work time. But hear me out on this first. This is a free event, which means no expensive expense approval. It included lunch so no personal cost apart from transport to get there.</description>
