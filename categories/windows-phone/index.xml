      <description>My Microsoft Band finally arrived yesterday morning, so obviously I put it straight on (after a charge of course). Here is a chronicle of first impressions.
Setup Out of the box, setup was really easy. Simply following the instructions on the band and the phone made it simple. I paired it with my Windows Phone (a Lumia 930) and as soon as the connection was made, the two devices started to chat to each other, downloading updates for the band using my phone&amp;rsquo;s internet connection.</description>

      <description>This is a companion post for my talk at Wellington&amp;rsquo;s SLAMD user group on 6 July 2011.
Recently I took part in Nigel Parker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Release an App for Windows Phone 7 in 7 Days for a Chance to Win a New HTC 7 Trophy Phone&amp;rdquo; competition, with the intent of winning a Windows Phone 7 device. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to win the device, I did get a free 1 year subscription to the App Hub, allowing me to develop and submit apps that I build, had fun doing it, and learned a few lessons along the way.</description>
