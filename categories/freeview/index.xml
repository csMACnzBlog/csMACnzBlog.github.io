      <description>Ive had my mythbox up and running for about a month now, and its working perfectly. Here are a few wee changes i had to make from the default xfce mythbuntu 8.10 I had to make. Mythwelcome I have my mythbox set up to autologin and run with the remote, without a keyboard and mouse. for this reason i needed it to have some way of getting back into mythtv frontend without having to remote login or plug in a keyboard.</description>

      <description>It has come to the end of another university year and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to once again start being a bit more regular with my blog posts.It also means i have more free time to start working on some projects of my own.The plan for this summer is to get a server running, to do samba/nfs file sharing and ldap authentication, as well as hopefully a mythtv server with a dual-tuner digital terrestrial card for watching and recording freeview here in New Zealand.</description>
