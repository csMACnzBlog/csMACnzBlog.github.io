      <description><p>In 2008 (8 years ago!) <a href="http://blog.csmac.nz/the-art-of-the-brick/">I blogged about the art of the brick</a>. I didn&rsquo;t join twitter until 2010, but if I had this probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been a blog post, really, since I can fit it in a quote right here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check out this guy who makes art out of Lego bricks. Very talented and very creative, a must see. His name is Nathan Sawaya and he is a 33 year old New York artist. I really wish I could be in America to go see his art museum exhibit, the pictures on his website show some amazing sculptures. go check out <a href="http://brickartist.com/">The Art of the Brick</a>. Well done mate. Thanks <a href="http://www.ursispaltenstein.ch/blog/weblog.php?/weblog/nathan_sawaya_the_art_of_the_brick/">Ursi</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 8 years later I finally start my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_experience">Big OE</a> traveling around Europe for a few years, first stop being Rome. And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, right down the road from my hotel is his <a href="http://www.romeguide.it/?pag=mostre&amp;tmo=mf&amp;idmos=6246&amp;lang=eng">traveling exhibit</a>!  It was up there with many of the other museums and galleries I&rsquo;ve been to, just amazing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more amazing is that I had forgotten I had written about this before. I knew the artist when I saw the post on the street and felt very lucky to finally see an exhibit that I thought I would never get to see (since I was living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">a small nation in the Pacific Ocean</a>). But do you think I would recall that I had published something about him in the past?</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I blog. And talking to other bloggers they say the same. It is a record of things that I have discovered, figured out, and liked. It is for me, as a record that I can refer back to and find things to use again.  We blog first and foremost for ourselves. And the added benefit of doing so in a public forum is that like-minded people will be able to find value in it as well.  I can&rsquo;t count the times I&rsquo;ve searched something in Google only to find my own posts surfacing to the top.</p>

<p>This is why I blog. If you think there is a benefit to adding your own ideas to the global backup of our minds, maybe you should give it a try too?</p>
<p>For more information about Nathan Sawaya and his work, check out <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/nathan-sawaya">his artist&rsquo;s page on artsy.net</a>, and if you ever get the chance to view his works in person, I highly recommend it.</p>

      <title>Time for an update</title>
      <link>https://csmacnzblog.github.io/post/time-for-an-update/</link>

      <description><p>So I really should have posted something sooner, but I&rsquo;ve been so busy with other things. Anyway, Change should soon be coming, I have a whole backlog of things i need to post about, and I&rsquo;ve started using Twitter, which should result in this post being tweeted about due to a new plugin (fingers crossed). So here is my mental note, to myself and perhaps also a promise to the wider public, of what i hope to get done to this site over the next few months (I hope this is realistic enough :-) ).</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish Photo Album Application</li>
<li>Restyle the site</li>
<li>Add twitter and Social Networking to my site</li>
<li>Post about the HTML bridge</li>
<li>Post about DataTemplateSelector</li>
<li>Post about Attached Behaviour and default item selection</li>
<li>Post about Blend and UI Styling</li>
<li>Create a Silverlight frontend for WordPress</li>
<li>Create Silverlight Tag Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>And if i manage to get through all that I can probably afford to skip another month of not posting! lets see how we go aye?</p>

      <title>An ode to blogging</title>
      <link>https://csmacnzblog.github.io/post/an-ode-to-blogging/</link>

      <description><p>A friend emailed me today, and told me a grand epic that was a day in his life, and my first response to him was &lsquo;that story is blog-worthy, share it with the world why don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become more and more self-evident, that the world is full of linguistically capable, and even exceptional writers, many of whom would never have had a chance to use their gifts and let their unique genius be heard by others. But today, with the prominence of the internet, a uniquely powerful medium of free speech, anyone can have the opportunity to become the next great inspiring voice of tomorrow, following in the footsteps of people like Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luthor King, and even Buddha.</p>
<p>Now we see some of these people rising through the polls of top 500 blogs around the web, and there are so many that their power, it would seem, is less then when they could have been singled out from the crowd. But in another way, they are able to share the power with others, and give more people the chance to be heard, and for better and greater freedom of choice from the people. Sure this also leads to extremist voices being a lot more vocal and in the foreground, but doesn&rsquo;t that still mean that the balance of power remains even, that people still get the opportunity to freely choose the path less supported and more frowned upon? It seems that balance is one of the few constant things is this universe. I&rsquo;m getting a</p>
<p>little side tracked here. The point of this blog post was to share with everyone my view on blogs, and blogging, and people sharing their every thought and feeling, and how great that is for the whole world to both give and receive, in the form of written language. My friend may just start his own blog, and if given permission, i will add a link to it from here for anyone out there reading my less then impressive blog (for now) may follow some of my influences, and perhaps learn something along the way.</p>
<p>So happy blogging to all, and i look forward to reading what people have done, thought, and experienced this week on the world wide web.</p>
