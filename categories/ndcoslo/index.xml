      <description>Day 2 Day 2 of NDC Oslo. A bit less productive than the first. I needed a longer lunch and missed a couple of slots, but made the most of talking to some of the speakers for a bit over the break. There is so much going on that it just felt necessary.
Never-the-less, I did still pack in a few good choices throughout the day.
Rise of the Tech Influencer First up was Michelle Sandford with her talk &amp;ldquo;Rise of the Tech Influencer - Small steps you can take to increase your reach&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>With 10 streams on, there has been a lot to choose from at NDC in Oslo. But as day one ends, I&amp;rsquo;ve now voted with my feet. And since I can&amp;rsquo;t be in two places at once (though the overflow does technically make this possible) these are the decisions I made, and a few takeaways from each.
Day 1 I was pretty much jumping from one session to the next today but had a little time to walk the stalls first.</description>
