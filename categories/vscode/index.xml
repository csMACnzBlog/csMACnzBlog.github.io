      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Fira Code as my new dev font. And I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with it.
FiraCode is available on GitHub, and is a based on the concept of ligatures, targeting at programming symbols.
In short, ligatures are where two or more actual characters are printed as a single printable character, originating in print where certain letters in certain orders would have a special stamp to use in the printing press to represent them.</description>

      <description>Getting Started with Visual Studio Code? Me too. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it takes to get going. This is a bit of a companion piece alongside my .Net Core Series I am writing at the moment. Hopefully as well as .Net Core, I will have a play with writing TypeScript, Rust and maybe C++ inside Visual Studio Code. I might have to focus on the interface in another article as well.</description>
