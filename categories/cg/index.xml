      <description>I am just about ready to start becoming a contributing member of YouTube. For the last six weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking part in a Summer School Paper at my University to develop and make a short 2-5 minute movie. The paper essentially sums itself up as &amp;lsquo;YouTube for credit&amp;rsquo; according to one of the organisers. This has been a great experience and has the end result of me having a movie showing tomorrow and my video published on the course&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel.</description>
